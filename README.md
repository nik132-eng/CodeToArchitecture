# 🏗️ System Design Practice  
> Learning from [InsightVeda - Software Architecture Lessons](https://softwarearchitecturelessons.com)

A focused repository to practice and internalize key system design and software architecture concepts from the **free, in-depth series**:  
**[Software Architecture Lessons](https://softwarearchitecturelessons.com)**  
*Built for curious minds who aspire to architect great systems.*

I’m going through each lesson, taking notes, drawing diagrams, and applying concepts — one step at a time.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

As I progress, I'll organize content like this:
```
System-Design-Practice/
│
├── lesson-01-microservices-principles/
├── lesson-02-system-design-framework/
├── lesson-03-ddd-microservices/
├── ...
├── certifications/
│   └── aws-clf-c02/      # AWS Cloud Practitioner prep
└── resources/
    └── diagrams/         # Mermaid or image files
```

Each folder will include:
- A markdown note (`README.md`)
- Key concepts
- Diagrams (text-based or images)
- Trade-offs & real-world applications

---

## 🎯 How I’ll Use This Repo
- ✍️ Write **in my own words** — to reinforce learning
- 🖼️ Create **simple diagrams** (using Mermaid or text)
- 💬 Document **trade-offs** and alternatives
- 🔁 Review and **revise notes** over time
