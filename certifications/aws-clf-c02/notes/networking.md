## üéØ Key Concepts

### Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

**Overview**: Isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources.

**VPC Components**:
- **VPC**: Virtual network isolated from other VPCs
- **Subnets**: Subdivision of VPC IP address range
- **Route Tables**: Control traffic routing between subnets
- **Internet Gateway**: Enables internet access for VPC
- **NAT Gateway/Instance**: Enables outbound internet access for private subnets
- **VPC Peering**: Connect VPCs together
- **Transit Gateway**: Central hub for VPC connections

**VPC Features**:
- **Custom IP Address Range**: Choose your own CIDR block
- **Multiple Subnets**: Public and private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Stateful firewall at instance level
- **Network ACLs**: Stateless firewall at subnet level
- **Flow Logs**: Monitor network traffic

### Subnets

**Overview**: Subdivision of VPC IP address range, located in specific Availability Zones.

**Subnet Types**:
- **Public Subnet**: Has route to Internet Gateway
  - Resources can have public IP addresses
  - Use cases: Web servers, load balancers, NAT gateways

- **Private Subnet**: No direct route to Internet Gateway
  - Resources cannot have public IP addresses
  - Use cases: Databases, application servers, internal services

**Subnet Features**:
- **AZ-specific**: Each subnet exists in one AZ
- **CIDR blocks**: Define IP address range
- **Route tables**: Control traffic routing
- **Auto-assign public IP**: Automatically assign public IPs

### Security Groups

**Overview**: Virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.

**Security Group Features**:
- **Stateful**: Return traffic automatically allowed
- **Instance-level**: Applied to individual instances
- **Default deny**: All traffic denied by default
- **Rules**: Allow specific traffic based on protocol, port, source
- **Multiple groups**: Instance can belong to multiple security groups

**Security Group Rules**:
- **Type**: Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
- **Port Range**: Specific port or range
- **Source/Destination**: IP address or security group
- **Description**: Optional description for rule

### Network ACLs (NACLs)

**Overview**: Stateless firewall that controls traffic at the subnet level.

**NACL Features**:
- **Stateless**: Both inbound and outbound rules must be defined
- **Subnet-level**: Applied to entire subnet
- **Default allow**: All traffic allowed by default
- **Rule numbers**: Processed in numerical order
- **Explicit deny**: Can explicitly deny traffic

**NACL vs Security Groups**:
- **NACL**: Subnet-level, stateless, default allow
- **Security Group**: Instance-level, stateful, default deny

### Amazon Route 53

**Overview**: Scalable DNS web service for domain registration and routing.

**Route 53 Features**:
- **Domain Registration**: Register and manage domains
- **DNS Resolution**: Convert domain names to IP addresses
- **Health Checks**: Monitor resource health
- **Traffic Routing**: Route traffic based on policies
- **Private DNS**: Internal DNS for VPCs

**Route 53 Record Types**:
- **A**: IPv4 address
- **AAAA**: IPv6 address
- **CNAME**: Canonical name (alias)
- **MX**: Mail exchange
- **TXT**: Text records
- **NS**: Name server

**Route 53 Routing Policies**:
- **Simple**: Single resource
- **Weighted**: Distribute traffic by weight
- **Latency**: Route to lowest latency
- **Failover**: Active-passive failover
- **Geolocation**: Route based on user location
- **Geoproximity**: Route based on geographic distance
- **Multivalue**: Multiple healthy resources

### AWS Direct Connect

**Overview**: Dedicated network connection from on-premises to AWS.

**Direct Connect Features**:
- **Dedicated Connection**: 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps
- **Hosted Connection**: 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps
- **Private Connectivity**: Traffic doesn't go over internet
- **Reduced Data Transfer Costs**: Lower egress costs
- **Consistent Performance**: Predictable network performance
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Connect on-premises to AWS

**Direct Connect Components**:
- **Connection**: Physical connection to AWS
- **Virtual Interface**: Logical connection
- **VLAN**: Virtual LAN for traffic separation
- **BGP**: Border Gateway Protocol for routing

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)

**Overview**: Secure connection between on-premises and AWS VPC.

**VPN Types**:
- **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connect on-premises network to VPC
- **Client VPN**: Connect individual devices to VPC
- **AWS VPN CloudHub**: Connect multiple sites through AWS

**VPN Features**:
- **IPsec Encryption**: Secure data transmission
- **Static/Dynamic Routing**: Route traffic to AWS
- **High Availability**: Multiple VPN connections
- **Cost-effective**: Lower cost than Direct Connect

### AWS Transit Gateway

**Overview**: Central hub for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks.

**Transit Gateway Features**:
- **Centralized Management**: Single point of control
- **Route Tables**: Control traffic routing
- **Peering**: Connect multiple VPCs
- **Cross-Region**: Connect VPCs across regions
- **Shared Services**: Share resources across VPCs
