- **State Management**: Manage workflow state
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry and error handling
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute steps in parallel
- **Conditional Logic**: Branch based on data
- **Integration**: Works with 200+ AWS services

**Step Functions Types**:
- **Standard Workflows**: Long-running workflows
- **Express Workflows**: High-volume, short-duration workflows

**Step Functions States**:
- **Task State**: Perform work
- **Choice State**: Make decisions
- **Wait State**: Pause execution
- **Parallel State**: Execute branches in parallel
- **Map State**: Process arrays
- **Pass State**: Pass data through

### Amazon EventBridge

**Overview**: Serverless event bus that makes it easy to connect applications using data from your own applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services.

**EventBridge Features**:
- **Event Routing**: Route events to targets
- **Schema Registry**: Discover and manage event schemas
- **Custom Events**: Send custom events
- **Partner Events**: Third-party SaaS events
- **Event Buses**: Isolate events by source
- **Rules**: Define event routing rules

**EventBridge Sources**:
- **AWS Services**: Native AWS service events
- **Custom Applications**: Your own applications
- **SaaS Partners**: Third-party services
- **Custom Buses**: Isolated event buses

### Amazon API Gateway

**Overview**: Fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

**API Gateway Features**:
- **REST APIs**: HTTP APIs with full control
- **HTTP APIs**: Lightweight, low-latency APIs
- **WebSocket APIs**: Real-time two-way communication
- **API Management**: Throttling, caching, monitoring
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **Documentation**: Automatic API documentation

**API Gateway Types**:
- **REST APIs**: Full-featured REST APIs
- **HTTP APIs**: Simple, fast HTTP APIs
- **WebSocket APIs**: Real-time communication
