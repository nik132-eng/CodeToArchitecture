- **Analyze and attribute expenditure**

#### 6. Sustainability
- **Understand your impact**: Measure and monitor
- **Establish sustainability goals**
- **Maximize utilization**: Right-size and optimize
- **Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings**

### Design Principles
- **Design for failure**: Nothing fails, everything fails
- **Decouple components**: Loose coupling, high cohesion
- **Implement elasticity**: Scale up and down automatically
- **Think parallel**: Design for parallel processing
- **Leverage different storage options**: Choose the right tool for the job

## 1.4 Explain the AWS shared responsibility model

### AWS Responsibility (Security OF the Cloud)
- **Infrastructure**: Hardware, software, networking, facilities
- **Compute, storage, database, networking services**
- **Managed services**: RDS, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.
- **Global infrastructure**: Regions, AZs, Edge locations
- **Compliance certifications**: SOC, PCI, HIPAA, etc.

### Customer Responsibility (Security IN the Cloud)
- **Data**: Classification, encryption, backup, retention
- **Platform, applications, identity and access management**
- **Operating system, network, firewall configuration**
- **Client-side data encryption and data integrity authentication**
- **Security group and network ACL configuration**

### Shared Controls
- **Patch management**: AWS patches infrastructure, customer patches OS/applications
- **Configuration management**: AWS configures infrastructure, customer configures applications
- **Awareness and training**: Both parties responsible for their personnel

## 1.5 Distinguish between different cloud deployment models

### Public Cloud
- **AWS, Azure, Google Cloud**
- **Multi-tenant**: Resources shared among customers
- **Benefits**: Cost-effective, scalable, no maintenance
- **Use cases**: Web applications, development, testing

### Private Cloud
- **Dedicated infrastructure for single organization**
- **On-premises or hosted by third party**
- **Benefits**: Control, security, compliance
- **Use cases**: Sensitive data, regulatory requirements

### Hybrid Cloud
- **Combination of public and private cloud**
- **Connected via secure network**
- **Benefits**: Flexibility, gradual migration
- **Use cases**: Legacy systems, compliance, data sovereignty

### Multi-Cloud
- **Use multiple cloud providers**
- **Avoid vendor lock-in**
- **Benefits**: Best of breed, risk mitigation
- **Use cases**: Large enterprises, specific requirements
