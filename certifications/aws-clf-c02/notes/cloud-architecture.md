## Overview

This section covers fundamental cloud architecture concepts including High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery.

## Key Topics

### High Availability (HA)
- System uptime and reliability
- Redundancy and failover mechanisms
- Multi-AZ deployments
- Service level agreements (SLAs)

### Scalability
- Ability to handle increased load
- Vertical scaling (scale up)
- Horizontal scaling (scale out)
- Auto-scaling capabilities

### Elasticity
- Dynamic resource allocation
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Cost optimization through elasticity
- Pay-as-you-scale model

### Fault Tolerance
- System resilience to failures
- Redundancy strategies
- Failure detection and recovery
- Graceful degradation

### Disaster Recovery
- Business continuity planning
- Backup and restore strategies
- Multi-region deployments
- Recovery time objectives (RTO)
- Recovery point objectives (RPO)
