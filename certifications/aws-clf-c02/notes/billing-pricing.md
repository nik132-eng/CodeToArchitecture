## 🎯 Key Concepts

### AWS Pricing Philosophy

**Overview**: AWS follows a customer-centric pricing philosophy designed to provide value and flexibility.

**Core Principles**:
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use, when you use it
- **Pay less when you reserve**: Significant discounts for committed usage
- **Pay less when you use more**: Volume discounts for higher usage
- **Pay even less as AWS grows**: Economies of scale benefit customers

**Benefits**:
- **No upfront costs**: Start using services immediately
- **Flexibility**: Scale up or down as needed
- **Cost optimization**: Multiple pricing options for different needs
- **Transparency**: Clear, predictable pricing

### Compute Pricing Models
