## 2.3 Identify AWS access management capabilities

### IAM Components

#### Users
- **Individual identities** for people or applications
- **Long-term credentials**: Access keys, passwords
- **Permissions**: Attached via groups or policies
- **MFA**: Additional security layer

#### Groups
- **Collection of users** with similar permissions
- **Easier management** of permissions
- **Cannot contain other groups**
- **Users can belong to multiple groups**

#### Roles
- **Temporary credentials** for services or users
- **No long-term credentials** (more secure)
- **Cross-account access** capabilities
- **Service roles** for AWS services

#### Policies
- **JSON documents** that define permissions
- **Identity-based**: Attached to users/groups/roles
- **Resource-based**: Attached to resources
- **Inline vs Managed**: Custom vs AWS managed

### Policy Types

#### AWS Managed Policies
- **Pre-built policies** by AWS
- **Common use cases**: PowerUserAccess, ReadOnlyAccess
- **Regular updates** by AWS
- **Cannot be modified**

#### Customer Managed Policies
- **Custom policies** created by customers
- **Can be modified** and versioned
- **Reusable** across multiple identities
- **Better organization** than inline policies

#### Inline Policies
- **Embedded directly** in identity
- **Cannot be reused** or versioned
- **Deleted** when identity is deleted
- **Use for unique permissions**

### Access Patterns

#### Programmatic Access
- **Access keys**: Access Key ID + Secret Access Key
- **Temporary credentials**: STS tokens
- **Best practice**: Use roles instead of access keys
- **Rotation**: Regular key rotation recommended

#### Console Access
- **Username and password**
- **MFA**: Strongly recommended
- **Session duration**: Configurable
- **Sign-in URL**: Account-specific

#### Cross-Account Access
- **AssumeRole**: Temporary access to another account
- **External ID**: Additional security parameter
- **Duration**: Configurable (1 hour to 12 hours)
- **Audit trail**: CloudTrail logs all assume role calls
