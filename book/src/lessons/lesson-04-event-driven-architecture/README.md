- [ ] **Topic 4: Event Streaming** - Real-time data processing with streams
- [ ] **Topic 5: Message Brokers** - Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS/SNS
- [ ] **Topic 6: Event Store Design** - Designing reliable event storage
- [ ] **Topic 7: Event Versioning** - Managing schema evolution
- [ ] **Topic 8: Saga Pattern** - Managing distributed transactions
- [ ] **Topic 9: Event Replay** - Rebuilding state from events
- [ ] **Topic 10: Event Monitoring** - Observability in event-driven systems
- [ ] **Topic 11: Event Security** - Securing event-driven communications
