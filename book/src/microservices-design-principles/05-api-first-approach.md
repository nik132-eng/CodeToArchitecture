# 4. API First Approach

### Principle Explained
Adopting an API-first approach means that every microservice's functionality is exposed through a meticulously defined API. This standardization ensures seamless communication between services and external clients, irrespective of their underlying technologies or programming languages.

### Example Use Case
A financial application's Currency Conversion service would expose an API endpoint like `/convert?from=USD&to=EUR&amount=100`. This allows other services, such as a payments service, to utilize its functionality without needing to understand its internal implementation details.
