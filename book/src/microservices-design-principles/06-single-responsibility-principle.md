# 06 - Single Responsibility Principle

> üí° *"A microservice should have only one reason to change."*

This principle is the **foundation of clean microservices design**. It's simple to understand but **hard to master** in practice.

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) means:
> ‚úÖ Each microservice does **one thing** and does it **well**.  
> ‚ùå No service should handle multiple, unrelated responsibilities.  
> üéØ **One reason to change** = One responsibility.

When you get this right, your services become **focused, maintainable, and independently deployable**.  
When you get it wrong, you end up with **bloated services** that are hard to change and scale.

Let's dive deep into how to apply SRP correctly in microservices.

## üéØ What Is the Single Responsibility Principle?

> **SRP** = A class (or service) should have only **one reason to change**.

In microservices context:
> **SRP** = A service should handle **one business capability** and have **one reason to change**.

### ‚úÖ Good Examples (High Cohesion)

| Service | Single Responsibility | Reason to Change |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| `User Service` | Manage user lifecycle | User management requirements |
| `Payment Service` | Process payments | Payment processing rules |
| `Notification Service` | Send notifications | Notification delivery methods |
| `Inventory Service` | Track stock levels | Inventory management rules |

Each service has **one clear job**.

### ‚ùå Bad Examples (Multiple Responsibilities)

| Service | Multiple Responsibilities | Problems |
|---------|-------------------------|----------|
| `User Service` | Auth + Notifications + Analytics | 3 reasons to change |
| `Order Service` | Orders + Payments + Inventory | Tight coupling |
| `Notification Service` | Notifications + User Management | Violates SRP |

üìå **Golden Rule**:
> If you can't describe a service's job in **one sentence**, it's doing too much.

## üß± Why SRP Matters in Microservices

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Following SRP

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Independent Deployment** | Change notification logic ‚Üí only redeploy Notification Service |
| **Team Autonomy** | Teams can work on their service without coordination |
| **Easier Testing** | Test one responsibility at a time |
| **Better Scaling** | Scale notification service independently of user service |
| **Clearer Ownership** | "Who owns this?" ‚Üí Clear answer |

### ‚ùå Problems of Violating SRP

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Cascading Changes** | Change user auth ‚Üí must update notification service |
| **Deployment Coupling** | Can't deploy one without the other |
| **Team Conflicts** | Multiple teams fighting over the same service |
| **Testing Complexity** | Must test multiple responsibilities together |
| **Scaling Issues** | Can't scale notification independently of auth |

## üîç How to Identify SRP Violations

Ask these questions:

### 1. **"How many reasons does this service have to change?"**
```text
User Service changes when:
- User registration rules change
- Authentication methods change  
- User profile fields change
- Password policies change
‚Üí 4 reasons = SRP violation
```

### 2. **"Can I describe this service's job in one sentence?"**
```text
‚ùå "User Service handles authentication, notifications, and analytics"
‚úÖ "User Service manages user lifecycle and authentication"
```

### 3. **"If I change X, do I need to change this service?"**
```text
If I change email templates ‚Üí do I need to change User Service?
If YES ‚Üí SRP violation (notifications belong elsewhere)
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Apply SRP in Practice

### 1. **Identify Business Capabilities**

Start with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** concepts:

| Business Capability | Service Name | Responsibility |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| User Management | `User Service` | User lifecycle, profiles |
| Authentication | `Auth Service` | Login, tokens, permissions |
| Order Processing | `Order Service` | Order creation, status |
| Payment Processing | `Payment Service` | Payment methods, processing |
| Notification Delivery | `Notification Service` | Email, SMS, push notifications |

### 2. **Use the "One Reason to Change" Test**

For each service, ask: **"What would cause this service to change?"**

```text
‚úÖ Good: Payment Service
- Changes when: Payment processing rules change
- One reason = One responsibility

‚ùå Bad: User Service  
- Changes when: User rules change
- Changes when: Notification rules change  
- Changes when: Analytics rules change
- Multiple reasons = Multiple responsibilities
```

### 3. **Split Services by Responsibility**

When you find SRP violations, split the service:

```text
‚ùå Before: User Service
- User management
- Authentication  
- Notifications
- Analytics

‚úÖ After: Split into 4 services
- User Service (user management)
- Auth Service (authentication)
- Notification Service (notifications)  
- Analytics Service (user analytics)
```

---

## üß© Real-World Example: E-Commerce Platform

### ‚ùå SRP Violation: Monolithic User Service

```text
User Service handles:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User registration/login
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Password management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Email notifications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SMS notifications  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Push notifications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User analytics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Profile management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User preferences
```

**Problems:**
- 8 different reasons to change
- Email team can't deploy without coordinating with analytics team
- Can't scale notifications independently
- Testing is complex (must test all features together)

### ‚úÖ SRP Applied: Split Services

```text
User Service (Core)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User registration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Profile management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User preferences

Auth Service (Security)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Login/logout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Password management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Token management

Notification Service (Communication)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Email notifications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SMS notifications
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Push notifications

Analytics Service (Insights)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User behavior tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User metrics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User reports
```

**Benefits:**
- Each service has one reason to change
- Teams can work independently
- Can scale and deploy independently
- Easier to test and maintain

## üìä Diagram: SRP in Action

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Client] --> B[API Gateway]
  
  B --> C[User Service]
  B --> D[Auth Service]  
  B --> E[Notification Service]
  B --> F[Analytics Service]
  
  C --> G[User DB]
  D --> H[Auth DB]
  E --> I[Notification DB]
  F --> J[Analytics DB]
  
  C -->|UserCreated| K[Event Bus]
  D -->|UserLoggedIn| K
  E -->|NotificationSent| K
  F -->|AnalyticsUpdated| K
```

‚úÖ Each service:
- Has its own database
- Handles one responsibility
- Can be deployed independently
- Communicates via events

---

## üîó How Services Communicate (While Maintaining SRP)

### ‚úÖ Option 1: API Calls
```js
// User Service calls Auth Service
const authResult = await fetch('http://auth-service/validate-token', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ token: userToken })
});
```

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Event-Driven
```js
// User Service publishes event
await eventBus.publish('UserCreated', {
  userId: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  name: user.name
});

// Notification Service listens
eventBus.subscribe('UserCreated', async (event) => {
  await sendWelcomeEmail(event.email, event.name);
});
```

### ‚úÖ Option 3: Saga Pattern (for Complex Workflows)
```js
// Order Service orchestrates multiple services
const saga = new OrderSaga();
await saga.execute({
  createOrder: () => orderService.create(orderData),
  reserveInventory: () => inventoryService.reserve(orderData.items),
  processPayment: () => paymentService.process(orderData.payment),
  sendNotification: () => notificationService.sendOrderConfirmation(orderData.userId)
});
```

## üö´ Common SRP Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Solution |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **God Service** | One service does everything | Split by business capability |
| **Shared Database** | Services share data tables | Each service owns its data |
| **Cross-Service Dependencies** | Service A directly calls Service B's database | Use APIs or events |
| **Mixed Concerns** | Business logic mixed with infrastructure | Separate concerns |
| **Fat Service** | Service grows beyond its purpose | Extract new services |

## üß† Mentor's Insight: The "Change Test"

The best way to identify SRP violations:

> **"If I change [business requirement], how many services must I change?"**

### ‚úÖ Good (SRP Followed):
```text
Change: "Add two-factor authentication"
Result: Only Auth Service needs to change
‚Üí SRP is followed
```

### ‚ùå Bad (SRP Violated):
```text
Change: "Add email notifications for new users"  
Result: Must change User Service, Notification Service, and Email Service
‚Üí SRP is violated (User Service doing too much)
```

## üîÅ Migration Strategy: From Monolith to SRP

If you're starting with a monolith:

### 1. **Identify Bounded Contexts**
```text
Monolith contains:
- User management
- Order processing  
- Payment handling
- Notifications
- Analytics
```

### 2. **Extract Services One by One**
```text
Step 1: Extract Notification Service
Step 2: Extract Auth Service  
Step 3: Extract Payment Service
Step 4: Extract Analytics Service
```

### 3. **Use Strangler Pattern**
```text
Route new requests ‚Üí New services
Keep old requests ‚Üí Monolith
Gradually migrate ‚Üí All to new services
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Following SRP

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Independent Development** | Teams work in parallel |
| **Independent Deployment** | Deploy without coordination |
| **Independent Scaling** | Scale based on actual need |
| **Easier Testing** | Test one responsibility |
| **Better Monitoring** | Clear service boundaries |
| **Faster Development** | Smaller, focused codebases |

---

## üö´ When SRP Might Be Overkill

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Early-stage startup** | Start with fewer services, split later |
| **Simple application** | Don't over-engineer |
| **Small team** | Fewer services = less complexity |
| **Low traffic** | Monolith might be fine |

> üü° Rule: **Start simple, but design for SRP from the beginning.**

## üéØ Summary: Single Responsibility Principle

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ‚úÖ One service, one responsibility | ‚ùå One service, multiple jobs |
| ‚úÖ One reason to change | ‚ùå Multiple reasons to change |
| ‚úÖ Clear service boundaries | ‚ùå Blurred responsibilities |
| ‚úÖ Independent deployment | ‚ùå Coupled deployments |
| ‚úÖ Focused testing | ‚ùå Complex integration tests |

> ‚úÖ SRP enables **independent development, deployment, and scaling**.
