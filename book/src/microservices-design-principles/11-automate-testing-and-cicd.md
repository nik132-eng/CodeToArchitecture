# 10. Automate Testing and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Principle Explained
Microservices demand robust automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure each service functions correctly both in isolation and in integration. Combined with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, this enables frequent, reliable updates and prevents changes in one service from breaking others.

### Example Use Case
In a ride-sharing application, a developer updating fare calculation logic would trigger an automated test suite. This suite would immediately verify the update's impact on dependent services (e.g., payments, trip-scheduling), ensuring issues are detected and resolved pre-deployment.
