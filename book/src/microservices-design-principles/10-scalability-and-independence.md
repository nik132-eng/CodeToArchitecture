# 9. Scalability and Independence

### Principle Explained
A primary advantage of microservices is their ability to scale independently based on demand. Services requiring more resources, such as an e-commerce platform's search service, can be scaled up or down without impacting other services.

### Example Use Case
An online gaming platform might need to significantly scale its matchmaking service during peak hours, while its profile management service may not require the same level of scaling at that time, demonstrating independent scalability.
