# Welcome to Your Learning Journey

Welcome to your comprehensive learning journey into Software Architecture and System Design. As your senior mentor, my goal is to guide you step by step, demystifying complex concepts, explaining jargon, and connecting theory to practical, real-world applications. We'll build a strong foundation, starting with the critical principles of microservices and beyond.

# Your Project Structure

Your learning material is organized within a structured project, designed to facilitate a systematic approach to understanding complex systems. This structure helps in organizing code examples, documentation (often managed using tools like `mdbook`), and practice problems.

```
CODETOARCHITECTURE
├── .github/workflows
│   └── mdbook.yml
├── book / src
│   ├── introduction.md
│   └── SUMMARY.md
├── codeforces
├── Practice
└── README.md
```

This setup allows for continuous documentation and iteration, ensuring that your learnings are always up-to-date and easily accessible.
