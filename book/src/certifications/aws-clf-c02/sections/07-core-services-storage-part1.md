## Storage Classes (covered so far)
- S3 Standard: Frequent access, multi-AZ
- S3 Standard-IA: Infrequent access, retrieval fee
- S3 Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive: Archival (queued restores)

## Versioning & Lifecycle
- Versioning: Protects against accidental deletes/overwrites
- Lifecycle rules: Transition to IA/Glacier; expiration

## Security & Access (intro)
- Bucket policies vs IAM policies
- Block Public Access (account & bucket level)

## Example Steps
1. Create bucket in your nearest Region
2. Enable versioning
3. Upload object; overwrite and observe versions
4. Create lifecycle rule: transition to IA after 30 days
5. Test public block settings
